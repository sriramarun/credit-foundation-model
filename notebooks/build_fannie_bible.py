# The Fannie Mae Loan-Performance Data Bible

**One notebook that documents the entire dataset**: every column's meaning, which columns the model
is allowed to see (and which are held out as leakage), and the headline risk signal — the
**delinquency / default rate by year** across the whole loan book.

It reads a pre-computed statistics artifact so it renders instantly; regenerate that artifact with:

```bash
# representative 4% panel (fast; the deterministic hash sample is unbiased for rates)

## 3. Columns *included* in training vs *excluded* / *leakage*

The included/excluded split is **derived live** from `configs/fannie_mae/raw_schema.yaml` (all 113
source fields) and `configs/fannie_mae/baseline.yaml` (the `exclude` / `leakage` lists + the
id/time/label/gate roles), so this table can never drift from the config the model actually uses.

### The golden rule

We predict: **"Will this loan — healthy today — go bad in the next 12 months?"** So the model may
use only what you'd genuinely know **today, about a healthy loan**. One test sorts almost every
column:

> **Imagine a loan that is perfectly healthy right now. Would this column already have a meaningful
> value?**
> - **No** — it only fills in *after* trouble starts → **leakage** (using it = peeking at the answer).
> - **Yes, but it's a name / ID / duplicate / too-fine geography** → not cheating, just useless or
>   risky → **excluded**.

* **Model features** — everything not excluded and not leakage.
* **Excluded (non-features)** — ids, raw dates (superseded by derived ISO dates), high-cardinality
  geo, and non-tabular strings.
* **Leakage** — outcome / contemporaneous-state / post-default servicing columns.

### "If the delinquency columns are removed, how does training know a loan failed?"

The leakage rules apply to the model's **inputs**, not to the **answer key**. Two separate tracks:

* **Features (the question)** — what the model reads at the observation date; every delinquency /
  outcome column is stripped from this.
* **Label (the answer)** — `default_event`, which is *computed from* those same delinquency markers
  (`dlq_num >= 6`, or a credit-event zero-balance code) but kept on a separate track and pointed at
  the **future**: at observation date T we look forward `horizon_months` and ask "did this loan
  default by T+12?". That forward-looking yes/no is the label.

So the delinquency data **defines the answer key — it is just banned from the question paper.** It's
like a medical study: you record today's blood pressure and cholesterol (features), wait a year and
note who had a heart attack (label, which of course needs the outcome), then train the model to
predict the heart attack from *today's* vitals. Feeding the heart-attack record back in as an input
would be the leak — the model would score ~perfectly in testing and be useless on a living patient.
(This is exactly why the leaky config scores ROC 0.93 and the honest, gated one scores 0.73.)

### 3b. Excluded non-feature columns — "not cheating, just not good features"

These wouldn't leak the answer, but they'd add noise, duplicate something we already keep, or create
fairness risk. Four groups:

1. **Names & IDs** (`reference_pool_id`, `seller_name`, `servicer_name`, `master_servicer`,
   `deal_name`) — random labels; which pool or bank serviced the loan says nothing about the
   borrower's risk, and "which lender" can proxy for neighborhood/race (**fair-lending risk**).
2. **Raw dates we already use elsewhere** (`monthly_reporting_period` → derived `reporting_date`;
   `origination_date` → the temporal **split key**, not a feature; `first_payment_date`,
   `maturity_date`, and the IO/ARM schedule dates) — redundant with loan age / term / rate, and
   feeding the calendar date would let the model memorize "2007 loans defaulted" instead of learning
   credit risk.
3. **Too-fine geography** (`metropolitan_statistical_area`, `zip_code_short`) — thousands of codes →
   overfitting, and a classic redlining proxy. We keep `property_state` (coarse, safe granularity).
4. **A non-tabular string** (`loan_payment_history`) — a 24-character coded string of past-due
   status: not a clean number *and* basically a compressed delinquency history.

"""),
    md(r"""
### 3c. Leakage columns — "these secretly contain the answer"

Every one is **blank or zero for a healthy loan** and only gets a value once the loan is already in
trouble or already ended. If the model sees a value here, it's reading the outcome, not predicting
it. Six groups:

1. **The outcome itself** — `current_loan_delinquency_status`, `dlq_num` ("how many months behind"),
   plus our derived labels `default_event` / `prepay_event` / `is_performing`.
2. **Loan termination / zero-balance** (only filled when the loan *ends*) — `zero_balance_code` (+
   dates), `upb_at_the_time_of_removal`, `repurchase_date`.
3. **Foreclosure & loss dollars** (only exist *after* default) — `foreclosure_date`,
   `disposition_date`, `last_paid_installment_date`, and every cost/proceeds/write-off/accrued-
   interest amount booked while repossessing and selling a defaulted home.
4. **Modifications & workouts** ("the treatment reveals the disease") — `modification_flag`,
   principal forgiveness, modification/credit-event losses, `borrower_assistance_plan`, deferrals,
   and alternative delinquency resolutions: you only get these once you're *already* missing payments.
5. **REO listing** (`original_list_*`, `current_list_*`) — the property is being sold post-foreclosure.
6. **Loan holdback** (`loan_holdback_indicator` + date) — a distress hold Fannie places on loans
   about to hit a credit event.

**The subtle bit:** `current_loan_delinquency_status` is banned but `current_actual_upb` and
`current_interest_rate` are **kept** — same word "current," opposite verdict. Every healthy loan has
a current balance and rate (safe); only a *sick* loan has a non-zero delinquency status (leak).
Contemporaneous is fine; contemporaneous-*and-only-exists-when-things-go-wrong* is not.

### 4d. Is the 4% sample representative? — 4% panel vs 100% book

The pretraining panel is a **deterministic 4% hash sample on `loan_id`** (whole loan histories kept
or dropped together). This section proves the sample reproduces the whole book's 26-year default
curve — including the 2008–2012 crisis and the 2020–2021 COVID spike — not just its average.

Generate the two delinquency profiles (each streams ~5 columns, so the full-book pass is cheap),
then re-run this notebook:

```bash
# 4% sample (your pretraining panel)
python scripts/profile_fannie_dataset.py \
    --panel gs://sriram-credit-fm-data/output/raw/fannie_mae/panel_2000_2024.parquet \

    --raw-root gs://sriram-credit-fm-data/fannie_by_reporting \
    --out reports/delinquency_100pct.json --delinquency-only --no-vintage --no-loan-count
```

The **pooled** (loan-month-weighted) default rate is the robust headline; per-year gaps in thin
years (very low base rates) are just sampling noise. Note the panel stops at 2024 while the raw book
includes partial-2025, so part of any pooled gap is that **window mismatch**, not sampling bias.

## 6. Notes &amp; caveats

* **Sampling & representativeness.** The default profile runs on the ingested **4% panel**, a
  *deterministic hash sample on `loan_id`* — whole loan histories are kept or dropped together, so
  observed rates are **unbiased estimates** of the whole book. Point `--raw-root` at the raw source
  for exact whole-book numbers.
* **Label definition.** `default_event = (dlq_num >= 6, i.e. D180) OR zero_balance_code ∈
  {02, 03, 09, 15}`. `is_performing` gates the task to loans current at the observation date so the
  model predicts **new** defaults, not ones already in progress.
* **Leakage discipline.** Section 3c columns are never features. Splits are **by `loan_id`** (never
  by row) and temporal by **origination date** — see `docs/data/fannie_mae.md` and the decision log.
* **Unknown delinquency.** `current_loan_delinquency_status = 'XX'` (or blank after removal) becomes
  `dlq_num = <NA>`; every downstream consumer resolves it with `.fillna(False)`.
* **Field availability drifts over time.** Some fields are populated only after certain releases
  (e.g. `*_classic_fico` from Dec-2025, several loss/servicing fields post-2020) — high null % on
  those columns is expected, not a data error.
