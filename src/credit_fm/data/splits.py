"""Loan-stratified temporal split for credit panel data.

Splitting a credit panel by *row* leaks loans across train/test: cutoff 6 of a loan can
land in train while cutoff 7 lands in test, so the model effectively sees the same loan
twice and the test score is fake. This module instead splits by ``loan_id`` (every cutoff
of a loan stays in one split) and orders the split by **origination date** (train < val <
test in time), so evaluation mirrors production — a model trained on older loans is tested
on newer ones.

Label-horizon leakage (e.g. ``default_within_6m`` needing the cutoff to be >= 6 months
before the panel end) is handled at the label-generator layer, not here.
