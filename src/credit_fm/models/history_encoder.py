"""History Encoder — contextualises the loan's timeline into one per-loan embedding.

Takes the profile vector and the per-event vectors (from the Profile and Event encoders) and runs
a transformer over the short sequence::

    [LOAN]  profile_vec  event_0  event_1  ...  event_{E-1}

A learnable ``[LOAN]`` token (the ``[USR]`` slot) aggregates the whole timeline; its output is the
**loan embedding** used downstream. RoPE encodes event order (oldest → newest), and a padding mask
hides absent events. The contextualised event vectors are also returned (broadcast back to tokens
by the MLM head as cross-event context).
